# Fire-Detection-and-Alarm-System

This model presents a fire detection and alarm system implemented using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze real-time images or video feeds from fire-prone areas. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of fire and non-fire images to accurately identify fire occurrences. Once a fire is detected, the system triggers an alarm and sends notifications to relevant authorities for prompt action. The use of TensorFlow allows for efficient and reliable fire detection, enhancing safety measures and minimizing potential damages caused by fires.
